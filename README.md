# Unlimited Trade Copier Pro MT5

This code is a sample implementation of a trade copier program for the MetaTrader 5 platform. The trade copier allows users to copy trades from a provider's account to multiple receiver accounts. The code provides functions for connecting to MT5 accounts, switching between provider and receiver roles, setting subscription expiry for receivers, copying trades, handling errors, optimizing code, testing the code, and documenting the code.

## How It Works

The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks related to trade copying. Here's a detailed explanation of each function:

1. `Connect()`: This function establishes a connection to the MT5 accounts. The actual code to establish the connection is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

2. `Disconnect()`: This function disconnects from the MT5 accounts. The actual code to disconnect from the accounts is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

3. `SwitchRole(int role)`: This function allows the user to switch between the provider and receiver roles. The role parameter should be either `ROLE_PROVIDER` or `ROLE_RECEIVER`. The function updates the `g_role` variable accordingly.

4. `SetSubscriptionExpiry(int expiry)`: This function sets the subscription expiry for each receiver. The expiry parameter represents the number of days until the subscription expires. The function updates the `g_subscriptionExpiry` variable accordingly.

5. `CopyTrades()`: This function copies trades from the provider's account to the receiver accounts. It first checks if the connection is established and the role is set to provider. If the subscription expiry is set, it checks and limits the signal reception to the specified time period. The actual code to copy trades to multiple receiver accounts is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

6. `HandleErrors()`: This function handles errors and exceptions that may occur during trade copying. The actual code to handle errors and exceptions is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

7. `OptimizeCode()`: This function provides code optimization techniques to improve performance and resource usage. The actual code optimization techniques are not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

8. `TestCode()`: This function performs thorough testing of the code. The actual code testing procedures are not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately.

9. `DocumentCode()`: This function generates a documentation string that provides instructions for using the code. It describes each function and its purpose. The documentation string is returned as the output of this function.

10. `OnStart()`: This is the entry point function of the code. It calls the `Connect()` function to establish a connection, copies trades if the role is set to provider, disconnects from the accounts, handles errors and exceptions, optimizes the code, tests the code, generates documentation, and prints the documentation.
